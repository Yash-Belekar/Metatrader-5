# Metatrader-5
MetaTrader5 is a good source of data so here I am attaching source code for downloading different currency pairs. Functions of use are in mt5_ea_conductor class with TIMEFRAME Set for 1 min here. Data of various instruments can be downloaded by logging onto your metatrader account and getting the symbols. I hope this helps thanks!
